# Configuration

Workflows are configured in a file called `.github/.probot.js` in your repository.

```js
// Auto-respond to new issues and pull requests
on(['issues.opened', 'pull_request.opened'])
  .comment('Thanks for your contribution! Expect a reply within 48 hours.')
  .label('triage');

// Auto-close new pull requests
on('pull_request.opened')
  .comment('Sorry @{{ user.login }}, pull requests are not accepted on this repository.')
  .close();
```

## Workflows

Workflows are composed of:

- [`on`](#on) - webhook events to listen to
- [`filter`](#filter) (optional) - conditions to determine if the actions should be performed.
- actions to take in response to the event

### `on`

Specifies the type of GitHub [webhook event](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) that this behavior applies to.

See also [Probot documentation](https://probot.github.io/api/latest/Robot.html#on).

```js
on('issues')
```

You can also specify multiple events to trigger this behavior:

```js
on(['issues', 'pull_request'])
```

Many events also have an `action` (e.g. `created` for the `issue` event), which can be referenced with dot notation:

```js
on('issues.labeled', 'issues.unlabeled')
```


### `filter`

Only perform the actions if the function returns `true`. The `event` is passed as an argument to the function and attributes of the [webhook payload](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events).

```js
.filter(event => event.payload.issue.body.includes('- [ ]'))
```

### `comment`

Comments can be posted in response to any event performed on an Issue or Pull Request. Comments use [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for templates and can use any data from the event payload.

```js
.comment('Hey @{{ user.login }}, thanks for the contribution!');
```

### `deleteComment`

Deletes the comment for the `issue_comment`, `commit_comment`, and `pull_request_review_comment` events.

```js
.deleteComment();
```

### `close`

Close an issue or pull request.

```js
.close();
```

### `open`

Reopen an issue or pull request.

```js
.open();
```

### `lock`

Lock conversation on an issue or pull request.

```js
.lock();
```

### `unlock`

Unlock conversation on an issue or pull request.

```js
.unlock();
```

### `label`

Add labels

```js
.label('bug');
```

### `unlabel`

Add labels

```js
.unlabel('needs-work').label('waiting-for-review');
```

### `assign`

```js
.assign('hubot');
```

### `unassign`

```js
.unassign('defunkt');
```

### `createIssue`

Create a new issue defined as a JSON Object. The `title` and `body` fields are required.

```js
.createIssue({
  title: 'Issue Title',
  body: 'Issue Body',
  assignees: ['bkeepers']
  labels: ['question']
});
```

The `body` of the issue can be generated from the contents of a template file within the repository by invoking the `contents` function.

```js
.createIssue({
  title: 'Issue Title',
  body: contents('.github/NEW_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md'),
  assignees: ['bkeepers'],
  labels: ['question']
});
```

## include

Loads a configuration from another file.

```js
include('.github/bot/issues.js');
include('.github/bot/releases.js');
```

You can also include configuration from another repository.

```js
include('user/repo:path.js#branch');
```

## contents

Retrieves the contents of the repository and passes them to any plugin method.

```js
on('issues.opened').comment(contents('.github/NEW_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md'));
```
This also supports fetching contents from another repository

```js
on('issues.opened').comment(contents('atom/configs:.github/NEW_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md'));
```

See [examples](examples.md) for ideas of behaviors you can implement by combining these configuration options.
